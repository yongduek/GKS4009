Introduction to Exploratory Machine Learning

1. python & pytorch
    1. python programming revisited: warming-up problems
    2. python programming: class and oop
    3. MNIST classification (first try)
    4. pytorch tutorial:
        - Linear network & softmax
        - Deep network: Batchnorm, ReLU, Skip connection

2. Problems, Models, Data types
    1. CNN models
        - MNIST classification       
        - audio data classification
    3. RNN models
        - sequence-to-sequence translation
        - LSTM and context memory
    5. Attention models and Transformer
        - d2l chapter 11 attention
        - Karpathy GPT tutorial 
    6. Meta-Learning: Learning to learn
